eSDee is a website where users can read, learn, and post about the city of San Diego. Users local and far can share their experiences about the city and help those who wish to travel to the city.
Finding fair and honest reviews about places, events, and restaurants can be hard for tourists. 
Our website aims to help out with this. 
The name of our website, “eSDee”, is a play on the phonetic spelling of SD, standing for San Diego.
